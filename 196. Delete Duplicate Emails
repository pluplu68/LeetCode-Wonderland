Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

📍DELETE u1 
FROM Person u1
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT MIN(id) as id, email
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
) u2 ON u1.id = u2.id
WHERE u2.id IS NULL;

📍DELETE p2 FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND p2.Id > p1.Id;
