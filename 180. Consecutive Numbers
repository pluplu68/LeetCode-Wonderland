Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

üìç# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT distinct l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1 JOIN Logs l2 ON (l1.id = l2.id - 1 AND l1.num = l2.num)
JOIN Logs l3 ON (l2.id = l3.id - 1 AND l2.num = l3.num)

üìç METHOD 2
select disctinct l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
from
Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
where
(l1.num = l2.num and
l2.num = l3.num and
l1.id = l2.id + 1 and
l2.id = l3.id + 1)

üìçslightly difference: disctinct ‚âà group by 
select l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
from
Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
where
(l1.num = l2.num and
l2.num = l3.num and
l1.id = l2.id + 1 and
l2.id = l3.id + 1)
GROUP BY l1.num
